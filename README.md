# SVM Softmax Classifier for CIFAR10

This implements a Softmax Neural Network classifier using the data set CIFAR-10. 

The classifier saves the model in a folder named "model" after you finish the training.
In each iteration of training function, it also shows the testing accuracy. 
No convolutional layers are allowed in this project.
